The following folder is used to store Google Earth .kml files for reference when working on existing XT sectorfiles. 

We only have access to the .kml files created post 2025. At current that includes:

- UBBB (WIP)

- UGSB

All other airports do not have .kml files readily available, and any change to files will need to be improvised, or started from scratch.
